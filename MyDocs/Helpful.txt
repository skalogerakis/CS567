Attributes for debugging purposes

.is_a attribute for getting the list of superclasses
.subclasses() method returns the list of direct subclasses of a class
The .descendants() and .ancestors() Class methods return a set of the descendant and ancestor Classes (including self,
but excluding non-entity classes such as restrictions).
To obtain all equivalent classes, including indirect ones (due to transitivity), use .INDIRECT_equivalent_to.
.instances() class method can be used to iterate through all Instances of a Class (including its subclasses). It
returns a generator.
